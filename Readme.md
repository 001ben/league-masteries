# League Masteries App
This app lets you search your highest and lowest league of legends masteries for each role

This is a fairly basic web app that I created both for myself, and to experiment with the riot API.

See it running at http://league.benjamentech.com

# Setting Project up for yourself
If you want to set the project up for yourself, clone the repo and add your own Riot Developer API key to config.js in the main directory, then just run it with Meteor JS
